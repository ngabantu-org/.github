# 🔐 Security Policy

Ngabantu takes security and privacy seriously.

We design our systems to respect **human dignity, data sovereignty, and trust boundaries** — not just compliance checklists.

---

## 📣 Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Ngabantu repository or service, **please report it responsibly**.

### 📧 Contact
Email: **security@ngabantu.com**

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code

If the issue affects a specific repository, mention it explicitly.

## ⏱️ Response Expectations

We aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **72 hours**
- Provide a status update once triaged
- Work collaboratively toward a responsible fix

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and scope.

---

## 🔍 Scope

This policy applies to:
- Public Ngabantu GitHub repositories
- Official Ngabantu services and APIs
- Enterprise Flutter plugins distributed by Ngabantu

Out of scope (unless explicitly stated otherwise):
- Third-party dependencies
- Forks not maintained by Ngabantu
- Self-hosted deployments with local modifications

---

## 🛑 Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:
- Do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before coordination
- Do **not** exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Allow reasonable time for remediation

We commit to acting in good faith and expect the same in return.

---

## 🧠 Our Security Philosophy

- Privacy-first by default
- Least privilege everywhere
- Explicit trust boundaries
- Clear auditability
- Long-term maintainability over short-term fixes

Security is not a feature — it is a **continuous responsibility**.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

We appreciate the work of security researchers and engineers who help keep Ngabantu safe.
