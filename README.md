## ✨ Why Ngabantu

Ngabantu is a **privacy-first, mobile-native workforce platform** designed to support the **entire employee lifecycle** — from recruitment to growth — inside one **connected, trusted system**.

We believe software should reflect how people *actually* work together — not reduce them to metrics, surveillance, or disconnected tools.

> **“umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”**  
> *A person is a person through other people.*

This African philosophy (Ubuntu) is the foundation of Ngabantu.
